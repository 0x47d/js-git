# BountySource Backers

After the successful KickStarter, I decided to do a second fundraiser so that I could continue working on js-git.  This was done as a [bountysource fundraiser][].  These are the people that contributed there. (Many were repeat contributers)

## Innovation Enabler

> At this level of support, you are truly enabling open development.  I assume you are backing on behalf of a company who can use js-git.  I'll send you a small pack of stickers and a few t-shirts.
>
>Also, for being so awesome, I can fly out to visit your team to discuss how to integrate js-git once it's usable (US only unless you help cover costs).

 - Mozilla <https://www.mozilla.org>

## Heavy Backer

> For committing to back a substantial amount of the project, I'll send you stickers, tshirts.
>
> Also I'll list you in BACKERS-2.md with your name, url, and short blurb.

 - Adobe <http://www.adobe.com/>

## Supporter

> For backing this project we'll send you a js-git laptop sticker so you can show your support to the world.
>
>Also you will be listed in BACKERS-2.md for all history to see.

TODO: List 11 people who contributed here.

## Basic Supporter

> Your name will be listed in BACKERS-2.md in the main source tree of js-git.
